Project Overview: Mr Luther's KS3 Computing
1. High-Level Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop an engaging, web-based educational platform featuring a suite of interactive tools and games. These resources are designed to support the Key Stage  3 (KS3) Computing curriculum in the UK, making learning key concepts both fun and effective.

2. Target Audience
The application is specifically designed for KS3 students (Years 7, 8, and 9), who are typically between the ages of 11 and 14. The content, design, and activities will be tailored to be accessible and appealing to this age group.

3. Technical Stack
The project is built using a modern and robust set of web technologies:

Framework: React (for building a dynamic, component-based user interface)

Language: TypeScript (for adding static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (for rapid, utility-first styling and a consistent design)

Architecture: A modular, component-based structure that separates concerns into distinct folders:

src/components: Reusable UI elements (Header, Navbar, etc.).

src/pages: Top-level components for each section of the site.

src/data: Static data used by the application.

src/types: Centralized TypeScript type definitions.

4. Current & Planned Modules
The application is structured into several modules, each focusing on a different area of the KS3 Computing curriculum.

Completed Modules:
Input & Output Tool: A drag-and-drop activity where students categorize computer hardware into a Venn diagram (Input, Output, Both).

Modules in Development:
IT Skills: This section will focus on fundamental computer literacy.

Mouse Skills Game (Made): An interactive game designed to help students master essential mouse operations:

Single-clicking

Double-clicking

Dragging and dropping

File & Folder Simulation (Planned): A tool that simulates the Windows desktop environment, allowing students to safely practice:

Creating folders

Renaming files and folders

Deleting files and folders

Future Modules (Placeholders):
Networks: To teach concepts like network topologies, IP addresses, and the internet.

Algorithms: To introduce fundamental sorting and searching algorithms visually.
