# Project Overview: Mr Luther's KS3 Computing

## 1. High-Level Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop an engaging, web-based educational platform featuring a comprehensive suite of interactive tools and games. These resources are designed to support the Key Stage 3 (KS3) Computing curriculum in the UK, making learning key concepts both fun and effective through hands-on activities.

## 2. Target Audience
The application is specifically designed for KS3 students (Years 7, 8, and 9), who are typically between the ages of 11 and 14. The content, design, and activities are tailored to be accessible, engaging, and age-appropriate for this demographic.

## 3. Technical Stack
The project is built using a modern and robust set of web technologies:

**Framework**: React 19 (for building a dynamic, component-based user interface)

**Language**: TypeScript (for static typing, enhanced code quality, and maintainability)

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling and consistent design system)

**Routing**: TanStack Router with file-based routing (for type-safe, URL-based navigation)

**Build Tool**: Vite 7 (for fast development and optimized production builds)

**Architecture**: A modular, component-based structure with clear separation of concerns:

- `src/routes/`: File-based routing with automatic type generation
- `src/components/`: Self-contained, reusable UI components
- `src/data/`: Static data and configuration files
- `src/types/`: Centralized TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/`: Shared utility functions

## 4. Current Modules & Activities

The application is structured into several curriculum-aligned modules, each focusing on different areas of KS3 Computing:

### ðŸ“š **Completed Modules:**

#### **Hardware & Software Section**
- **Input/Output Classification Tool**: Interactive drag-and-drop Venn diagram where students categorize computer hardware components (Input, Output, Both categories)
- **ASCII/Binary Converter**: Tool for converting between text, ASCII codes, and binary representations
- **Hardware Identification**: Quiz-style activity for recognizing and naming computer hardware components

#### **IT Skills Section** 
- **Mouse Skills Challenge**: Comprehensive mouse control training featuring:
  - Precision tracing exercises
  - Single-click accuracy training

  - Identify suspicious email elements (sender, subject, content)
  - Recognize common phishing tactics and red flags
  - Practice safe email behaviors
  - Understand social engineering techniques
- **Social Credit Game**: Digital citizenship scenario-based game exploring:
  - Privacy and data protection decisions
  - Consequences of online behaviors
