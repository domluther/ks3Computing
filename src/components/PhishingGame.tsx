							<li>
								<strong>Check the Sender:</strong> Look closely at the "From"

							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Look for Mistakes & Urgency:</strong> Professional
								companies rarely send emails with spelling or grammar errors. Be
								suspicious of messages that pressure you to act "immediately" or
								threaten you with negative consequences.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Hover, Don't Click:</strong> Always hover your mouse
								over links before clicking. A tooltip will show you the real
								website address. If it looks suspicious or doesn't match where
								the link claims to go, don't click it.
